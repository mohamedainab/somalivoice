# Somalivoice
SomaliVoice is an initiative to teach computers to speak and understand the Somali language.

## First Phase
We want to collect as much voice data as we can gather. We want to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of Somali people. 

## Second Phase
We want to build a voice recognition engine that can run on different platforms, from mobile to desktop systems.
